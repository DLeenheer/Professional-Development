# What did you do last week?
- I created a post in piazza listing my initial project ideas, which included learning Tableau, R, or studying for the AWS cloud practitioner exam

# What do you plan to do this week?
- I watched videos on the LinkedIn learning platform on the AWS cloud exam, Tableau, R, and a LinkedIn job search optimization tips video
- I accomplished all of these tasks and optimized my LinkedIn profile with some of the tips in the job searching video

# Are there any impediments in your way?
- Early on in the week I had a difficult time trying to decide which topic to focus on and decided that using this week as a 'try each topic out' week was the best strategy.

# Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I was able to cover a lot of ground this week. I discovered that the LinkedIn Learning platform has lots of general professional development videos on topics like job searching, optimizing your LinkedIn profile, technical interview prep, etc. Given this I will dedicating at least 1 hour each week to these topics along side my other data focused topics as I am currently looking for a new role and am between jobs.
- I also found a career path option on LinkedIn Learning, I selected Data Analyst. This pathway features Tableau and R and adds some structure to my learning so I will follow this pathway moving forward.
