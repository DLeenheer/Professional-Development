# What did you do last week?
- Reviewed the assigned project proposals from fellow students
- Continued the R section, this section has 3 mini courses and 7-8 hours of video
- Watched an interviewing tips video on LinkedIn Learning

# What do you plan to do this week?
- Keep working on the R section, there are 4-5 more hours of video between two courses left to go.
- The R section videos are very interactive. I have downloaded R and RStudio and am testing and trying out the various activities as a watch the videos.

# Are there any impediments in your way?
- The R section is taking a lot longer to get through than anticipated. This is due to the stop and start nature of the videos. I watch a section and then pause the video throughout to test out the activity in RStudio. This has been a really fun learning activity but is significantly growing the time needed to complete the section.

# Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- This past week I frequently stopped the R section video focused on data science to make sure I understood everything and have been following along by downloading R and RStudio and testing the activities out on my machine.
- Understanding R and becoming proficient enough to complete projects with it is a main goal of my project for this class so the extra time I'm spending on this section is worth it.
- Given the timeline of this class I will be pausing the video less during the rest of the R section, but still pausing when needed.
