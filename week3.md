# What did you do last week?
- I watched videos on the LinkedIn learning platform on the AWS cloud exam, Tableau, R, and a LinkedIn job search optimization tips video
- I accomplished all of these tasks and optimized my LinkedIn profile with some of the tips in the job searching video

# What do you plan to do this week?
- Review the project proposal I drafted and submit it
- Watch the remaining two business intelligence videos in the learning path and successfully pass the section reviews
- Start the R section
- Complete the rest of the Using LinkedIn to Job Search videos and successfully complete the section quizzes.

# Are there any impediments in your way?
- Making sure I complete enough of the videos and section quizzes to complete the project on time.

# Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I think that the learning path I created on the LinkedIn Learning site will provide the structure needed to successfully complete this project and better position me to apply for data analyst and business analyst roles.
- I noticed that these weekly posts are a great way to organize myself for the week. I will be completing these posts on Monday or Sunday each week to give myself a clear direction for the week.
