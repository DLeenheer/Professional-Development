# Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
- I took a long weekend trip to back to Michigan to visit family last week. I was able to keep on top of coursework while there however I ended up having a significant travel delay that caused me to significantly disrupt my normal sleep schedule. This issue caused me to fall behind some midweek last week. I have been much more on task this week.
- The learning is to not schedule trips during semesters, it just throws things off too much.
